	<h1> WHAT IS A DUMPLING? MEANING AND HISTORY BEHIND THIS DELICIOUS FOOD </h1>
<p> We think about dumplings a lot over here, including the dumpling meaning and the history behind them. That’s because it’s important to know the story behind your food, especially food that’s been passed down generation to generation across many cultures. Because dumplings have been around for so long and appear in so many different cultural cuisines, the exact details surrounding their origins are cloudy. That being said, we’ve gathered some fast facts for you on what’s generally considered to be the most widely accepted version of the dumpling’s history—including their inventor and how they became such a popular and meaningful food product in both Asia and other parts of the world. </p>

<h2> The History Of Dumplings </h2>	
<p>While the history of dumplings is often accepted as having started with Zhang Zhongjing, the general idea of dumplings as we know them today followed quite an interesting and varied trajectory. Because you can find dumpling variations in nearly every culture—Italian raviolis and Brazilian empanadas are just two of the offshoots of the traditional Chinese dumpling—the history of the dumpling has many different starting points, even if their official invention was during the Han Dynasty. While dumplings appeared in many forms for many centuries during ancient times, it wasn’t until the 17th century that they finally got their name. The first use of the term “dumpling” can be found in an English text from 1600, where it was noted that the word was perhaps of German origin. And while Zhongjing may have created dumplings in the first place to help people survive brutal winters, other cultures created dumplings for other reasons, such as to help extend the life of meat and to make use of surplus grains. In Todays World We have some variations of Dumpling Which Are Listed Below </p>
